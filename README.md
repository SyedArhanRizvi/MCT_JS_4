# Nested Comment Section

This project is a nested comment section built with HTML, CSS (Tailwind CSS), and JavaScript, allowing users to reply to existing comments and display replies in a structured, multi-level format. This feature emulates a typical comment thread found on social media platforms or forums.

## Features

- **Add New Comment**: Users can add new top-level comments.
- **Reply to Comments**: Users can reply to existing comments, creating a multi-level thread structure.
- **Responsive Design**: Tailwind CSS styling keeps the layout responsive and visually clean.
- **Dynamic Interactivity**: JavaScript enables dynamic addition of comments and replies.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** for the structure.
- **CSS** for responsive styling.
- **JavaScript** for dynamic comment creation and nesting.

## Project Structure

- **HTML**: Contains the main comment container with unique styling for comments and replies to create a visual hierarchy.
- **CSS**: Comments have unique backgrounds or borders, while replies have distinct styles to indicate hierarchy.
